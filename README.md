Hi, I'm a former PhD graduate in theoretical high energy physics who now works in management consulting for a European consulting company in Germany.
I'm interested in applying my analytical and mathematical skills to model and solve real world business problems. In addition, my skills comprise software development and engineering (Python, Java, C/C++, R) as well as AI methodologies.
